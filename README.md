# üè° House Price Prediction using Linear Regression

This project builds a machine learning model that predicts the price of a house based on its area (in square feet). It uses **Linear Regression**, a fundamental supervised learning technique, implemented with **Python** and **scikit-learn**.

The project includes:
- Data preprocessing and visualization
- Training a linear regression model
- Predicting prices for custom input areas
- Graphs showing relationships between features and predictions
- Exportable output as CSV

This is a great beginner project to learn how machine learning works in real estate price prediction scenarios.
